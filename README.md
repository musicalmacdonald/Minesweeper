# Minesweeper
Console App version of the classic game, which I'm using to solidify OOO concepts and Java language basics.  Project from JetBrains Academy [linked here](https://hyperskill.org/projects/77).

The project is split into 5 parts listed below.  Each section must pass the JetBrains test suite in order to move on to the next set of lessons.

Note: Stage 5 is Work In Progress

- [x] Stage 1: Output a 9x9 field that places mines randomly (denoted by X's and not hidden at this point).
- [x] Stage 2: Ask the player how many mines should be on the field
- [x] Stage 3: Show the user how many mines are around each square
- [x] Stage 4: Add user interaction to set/delete flags, implement win scenario
- [ ] Stage 5: Hide the initial state & implement algorithm to show non-mine squares based on user input, implement loose scenario
